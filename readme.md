Also outlined below if the link becomes outdated:

We want you to experience the technology choices we have made at RiskSmart in a small slice, so this is not only a tech test, but also an opportunity for you to get a feel for what it would be like to work at RiskSmart.

For this test, we will be excluding all cloud and CICD aspects, so we can focus on some core skills. We want you to show us what you're capable of, and we will not be marking the test against a set criteria. We want you to think, pivot, and be creative, just as we do every day.

Here is an outline of the test:

Create a single-page application (SPA) that  lists employees within a company in formatted table, retrieved from a GraphQL endpoint.

Allow editing of the row in a pop-up form and update the data source.

Think in a product mindset and consider what features the app should have.

Please use the following:

- TypeScript
- Tailwind or CloudScape (AWS)
- Apollo (or another GraphQL client/server)
- Any SQL-based database
- Docker to host and allow local use
- Any other libraries that can help and Google like we do!

Use a README file to outline all that you want us to look at or to get the app running.

submit by supplying a GitHub (or other) address.

## Setup

Project consists of a [frontend](/frontend/README.md) and a [api](/api/README.md) folder. 

Follow the individual readmes to get setup.


## Notes: 

Make sure to seed some company and employee data first otherwise the table wont display

Docker might not work (I don't have docker setup on my personal computer due to hardware limitations)
